          <p>
            In todayâ€™s classrooms, AI is often met with suspicion. Educators fear that students will outsource thinking. The real challenge is not to ban AI, but to integrate it as a tool for critical thinking. Lyra is designed to be a smart, pedagogical assistant that guides students through problems with hints and Socratic questioning, much like a real tutor. It encourages students to verbalize their thought processes, a technique known as rubber duck debugging, to help them arrive at solutions on their own.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-headline">Core Components</h2>
          <p>
            Lyra is built on a foundation of modern AI technologies to provide a safe and effective learning experience.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):</strong> Lyra uses RAG to ground its responses in factual, course-specific information, reducing the risk of hallucination.</li>
            <li><strong>Vector Databases:</strong> For fast and semantically relevant information retrieval from lecture notes and documents.</li>
            <li><strong>Prompt Engineering:</strong> Carefully crafted prompts ensure the AI follows pedagogical rules, adapting to different teaching styles and subjects.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="font-headline">The Vision</h2>
          <p>
            Lyra aims to be a customizable and scalable AI tutoring platform with educational ethics at its core. It's a tool for learning, not just for getting answers.
