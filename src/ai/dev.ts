 * @fileoverview Main Entry Point for Development AI Server (`dev.ts`).

 * @description
 * This file serves as the primary entry point for the Genkit development server.
 * When you run the `pnpm genkit:dev` script, this is the file that gets executed. It
 * tells the Genkit development server which AI capabilities (the "flows") to load
 * and make available for testing and use.
 *
 * C-like Analogy:
 * Think of this file as the `main.c` for our AI development environment. Its sole
 * purpose is to "include" or "import" all the different AI function definitions
 * from the `src/ai/flows` directory. Just as `main.c` might include various
 * header files to bring in different modules, this file imports the flows to
* register them with the Genkit runtime.
