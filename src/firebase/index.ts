 * @description
 * This file acts as the central "public interface" for all Firebase-related
 * functionality in the application. It serves two main purposes:
 *
 * 1.  **Initialization:** It defines the primary `initializeFirebase()` function, which
 *     is responsible for setting up the connection to the Firebase backend. This
 *     function is designed to be idempotent (safe to call multiple times) and
 *     integrates with Firebase Hosting's automatic configuration.
 *
 * 2.  **Barrel Exporting:** It re-exports all the key functions, hooks, and types
 *     from the other files in this `firebase/` directory. This allows other parts of
 *     the application to import everything they need from a single, consistent location
 *     (e.g., `import { useUser, useCollection } from '@/firebase';`), rather than
 *     having to know the internal file structure.
 *
 * C-like Analogy:
 * This file is like the main `firebase.h` header file for your project. It includes
 * all the other necessary headers (`auth.h`, `firestore.h`, etc.) and provides
 * the main `firebase_init()` function. Any other C file that needs to use Firebase
 * functionality would just need to `#include "firebase.h"`.

/**
 * Initializes the Firebase app and returns SDK handles.
 * This function is idempotent; it checks if an app is already initialized before
 * creating a new one. It supports both automatic configuration via Firebase Hosting
 * and fallback manual configuration for local development.
 *
 * @returns {{ firebaseApp: FirebaseApp, auth: Auth, firestore: Firestore }} An object containing the initialized Firebase services.
 *
 * C-like Explanation: `FirebaseServices* initializeFirebase()`
 *
 * This function is the primary entry point for setting up Firebase.
 *
 * It uses a check, `getApps().length`, to see if a Firebase app has already been
 * initialized. This is like checking if a global `g_firebase_initialized` flag is true.
 *
 * **IMPORTANT: Firebase App Hosting Integration**
 * The `try...catch` block is special. Firebase App Hosting can automatically provide
 * Firebase configuration via environment variables on the server. The `initializeApp()`
 * function (when called with no arguments) is designed to detect and use these variables.
 * - `try`: We first attempt to initialize using this automatic method. This is the
 *   preferred way for production environments.
 * - `catch`: If that fails (which is normal in a local development environment), we
 *   fall back to using the hard-coded `firebaseConfig` object from `config.ts`.
