It prioritizes authorization independence and simplifies security rules using denormalization. The structure enables teachers to create and customize prompts that guide the AI's tutoring style. Since users log in with Firebase Authentication, all data will be secured by `request.auth.uid`. \n\nThe structure is segregated to ensure each collection has a homogeneous security posture.  Specifically, prompts are stored under the teacher's ID to ensure that prompts are isolated between teachers and that list operations are safe. This prevents unauthorized access and maintains data integrity.\n\nAuthorization Independence is achieved by storing the `teacherId` within the prompt document, eliminating the need for `get()` calls to verify ownership.\n\nQAPs are supported by the path-based ownership model for the prompts. Only the teacher associated with a prompt (via `teacherId`) can access or modify it."
